# NUTorrent
Might be the best torrent in the NU... maybe

# What is this..?
This repository meant for a torrent client which would be able to work in a UDP-blocking-environment, providing high speed at the same time.

# To-Do
* Think about the design of a torrent client
* What can be used as a core protocol (TCP or is there smth else?)
* Is it a command line tool or with GUI?
* For how many people it is meant?
* Will it use custom torrent-file-format?
* It would be nice to write a tool that would be able to create any PC into a torrent tracker
